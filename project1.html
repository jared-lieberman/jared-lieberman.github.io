      <h2 class="project-title">A Template for Transportability: Applying Soft Interventions to Generalize School Enrollment Effects in India</h2>
      <p class="project-description">      
        The central goal of transportability as a solution to the data fusion problem is to extract meaning and measurements in 
        an observational domain based on knowledge understood in one or more other domains. This project intends to construct 
        a template of performing transportability research in applied settings, using student participation in low income settings as the case study. The decision and motivation to attend school is a game of incentives based on a variety of factors such as financial costs, perceived benefits of education, and conditions of travel. The effects of these factors have been studied and measured extensively in the development economics literature. This project synthesizes the literature on student participation to situate the effects of five randomized control trials (RCTs) within the context of general transportability. I intend to use the causal machinery to determine nonparametric transportability from interventions in the source domains, and, if successful, subsequently measure the effects on student participation in India. This process will create a natural pathway for a templatized framework for transporting effects for applied researchers.

        The project utilizes applications in development economics to approach building a template of transportability. The input to the causal machinery is an annotated causal graph. The graph is constructed using a survey of domain knowledge of the ecosystem of factors impacting student enrollment and attendance, as well as empirical data from six domains: Afghanistan, Chile, India, Kenya, Morocco, and Pakistan. The causal graph is a selection diagram, encapsulating the soft interventions from five studies, encoded as sigma nodes, and selection nodes, indicating the disparities between each source domain and the target domain of India.

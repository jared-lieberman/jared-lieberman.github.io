      <h2 class="project-title">Indian Election Historical Schedule Dataset</h2>
      <p class="project-description">
        The Election Schedule Dataset is a corpus of data including all schedules for Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha elections from January 1967 to March 2022. The data come from the official Election Commission of India (ECI) website (https://eci.gov.in/), the Times of India archives, and the National Archives of India.
        The data includes dates of announcement, notification, last day of nomination, polling, counting, and result announcements for each election.
        This codebook provides information about the variables included in the Election Schedule dataset. The codebook will be updated as and when new information is added to the dataset.
        The information in this dataset has been taken from the aforementioned sources as of 19 September, 2022. Many of the data from 1998 to the present was sourced from press releases from the ECI website. The ECI website also includes statistical reports for General Elections and state-wise elections, in which many of the counting and result announcement dates were found. Prior to 1998, most of the dates were sourced from Times of India articles containing the announced programmes as well as additional articles announcing the results. Some earlier election schedules were found in the National Archives of India.

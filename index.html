      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a data scientist and interdisciplinary quantitative researcher,
        currently working as a Quantitative Analyst at <a href="https://www.eurasiagroup.net/" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">Eurasia Group</a>,
        a political risk research and advisory firm. I 
        contribute methodological expertise and support data science efforts
        at the Associate Director level on the Geoeconomics team.
        
        I recently received a MA in Statistics at Columbia University.

        My interests are in causal inference, experimentation, and machine learning.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to graduate school, I was a <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/news-events/news/alumni-receive-fulbright-nehru-fellowships" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">Fulbright-Nehru Research Fellow</a> 
        in India, where I conducted mixed-methods research on state-level elections and voter behavior. I was affiliated with the 
        Trivedi Centre for Political Data at Ashoka University, and performed research at the Centre for Policy Research.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also worked as a data scientist on a research and development team within the 
        Department of Revenue at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a software developer at 
        <a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">MIT</a>,
        and a technical intern at Evidence for Policy Design, housed within the 
        <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">Harvard Center for International Development</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Awards and Fellowships</h3>
      <p>
        My work at the Massachusetts state government was recognized with the Commonwealth Citation for Outstanding Performance Award. 
        I was also granted the Critical Language Enhancement Award by The Fulbright Program to fund my Hindi-language education.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2020, I was selected as part of the inaugural cohort of the <a href="https://a860-gpp.nyc.gov/downloads/9g54xk50q?locale=en" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">NYC[x] Innovation Fellowship</a>. 
        While at Columbia, I conducted <a href="https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/methods-tools-in-spatial-research/tutorials/MappingAfroBrazilianReligiousHistoriesAnAIAssistedTutorial.html" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">geospatial research</a> using NLP as a Data Science Institute Scholar with the Center for Spatial Research.

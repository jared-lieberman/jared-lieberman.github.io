      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a data scientist and interdisciplinary quantitative researcher,
        currently studying in the Statistics MA program at Columbia University. 
        My interests are in causal inference, experimentation, and machine learning.
        I also work in quantitative research at 
        <a href="https://www.eurasiagroup.net/" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">Eurasia Group</a>,
        a political risk consulting firm, where I contribute methodological expertise 
        and support data science efforts. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to graduate school, I was a Fulbright-Nehru Research Fellow in India, 
        where I studied state-level elections and voter behavior. I was affiliated with the 
        Trivedi Centre for Political Data at Ashoka University, and spent time at the Centre for Policy Research.
        I performed quantitative analysis, built a dataset from archival work, 
        and conducted interviews of Members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in Gujarat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also worked as a data scientist on a research and development team within the 
        Department of Revenue at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a software developer at 
        <a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">MIT</a>,
        and as a technical intern at Evidence for Policy Design, housed within the 
        <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">Harvard Center for International Development</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Awards and Fellowships</h3>
      <p>
        My work at the Massachusetts state government was recognized with the Commonwealth Citation for Outstanding Performance Award. 
        I was also granted the Critical Language Enhancement Award by The Fulbright Program to fund my Hindi-language education.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2020, I was selected as part of the inaugural cohort of the <a href="https://a860-gpp.nyc.gov/downloads/9g54xk50q?locale=en" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">NYC[x] Innovation Fellowship</a>. 
        While at Columbia, I conducted <a href="https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/methods-tools-in-spatial-research/tutorials/MappingAfroBrazilianReligiousHistoriesAnAIAssistedTutorial.html" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">geospatial research</a> using NLP as a Data Science Institute Scholar with the Center for Spatial Research.

      <h3>NYC Taxi Random Forest Classifier</h3>
      <p>
        Using the NYC public taxi data, the <a href="https://github.com/jared-lieberman/NYC_Taxi_Borough_Prediction/tree/master/nyc_taxi_random_forest" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">project</a> analyzes data from the three different types of rides (yellow taxis, green taxis, and for-hire rides)
         and uses a randome forest classifiers to predict which borough a ride will end in. I used data from January 2018 for each ride type. 
         The yellow taxi model performs at about 85% accuracy, the green taxi model performs at about 80% accuracy, and the for-hire rides 
         perform at about 65-70% accuracy.

      <h3>Transportability and External Validity in Evaluating Women’s Political Reservation Effects in India</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Ongoing:</i> This project aims to examine the generalizability of causal effects obtained from a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 
        specifically, the “Women as Policy Makers” (Duflo et. al.) study in India, to a new target population. Using the structural 
        causal model (SCM) framework, the project will build a formal SCM for the RCT data. Next, methods from 
        transportability and external validity, for example selection diagrams, will determine whether the 
        estimated effect (e.g., the impact of reserved political positions on local public good investments) can be identified 
        in a new population that differs in key covariates (such as socio-economic characteristics or cultural factors). The 
        project focuses on generalizability, robustness, and adaptation. Using 
        data from the RCT as well as additional relevant data from external sources, the project aims to bridge the gap between 
        rigorous experimental findings and policy decisions in varied real-world environments.

      <h3>NYC[x] Innovation Fellowship</h3>
      <p>
      In collaboration with the New York City Mayor’s Office of the CTO (MOCTO) and the Mayor’s Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes (OPHC), my team 
      developed the <a href="https://medium.com/nyc-mayors-office-of-the-cto/preventing-hate-dashboard-43883b24924f" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">Preventing Hate Dashboard</a>, a tool to better understand the landscape of hate crimes in New York City and 
      their community impact, explore potential underreporting, and identify gaps using publicly available data on hate crimes and demographics.

      <h3>Inferential Analysis of Citi Bike Ride Patterns</h3>            
      <p>
        The primary goal of the <a href="Citi Bike Ride Patterns.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">project</a> is to explore relationships between building energy
        efficiency and sustainable transportation. At a high level I was interested in whether certain
        types of people take or have the option to choose sustainable transportation, and generally in
        what contexts they do so. The case study is New York City, and I utilized inferential
        procedures, relying on linear regression models, to study more specifically relationships
        between building energy usage, Citi Bike ride patterns, and neighborhood socioeconomic and
        housing data. These data not only provide fertile ground for applying statistical techniques from
        the course, but also lay the groundwork for further research with important policy implications.

        This project, <a href="https://centerforspatialresearch.github.io/methods-tools-in-spatial-research/tutorials/MappingAfroBrazilianReligiousHistoriesAnAIAssistedTutorial.html" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">Mapping Afro-Brazilian Religious Histories: An AI-Assisted Tutorial</a>,
         examines the historical and spatial dimensions of witchcraft accusations in Rio de Janeiro during the 
        late 19th and early 20th centuries. By combining archival research with data science techniques, such as web scraping, 
        natural language processing (NLP), and geospatial mapping, the project helps to explore how accusations of witchcraft 
        were used to reinforce racial and class divides. Using the addresses of accused witches, the project aims to visualize 
        how these trials mapped onto the city, reinforcing social and spatial segregation. We started the process with a glossary 
        of about 60 relevant terms and performed searches across newspapers including Jornal do Brasil, Gazeta de Notícias, 
        Diário de Pernambuco, and Diário da Noite.

      <h3>Investigating Voter Turnout in Indian Elections</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this <a href="Investigating Voter Turnout in Indian Elections.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #3672c2; text-decoration: underline;">analysis</a> is to use Bayesian multilevel models to explore potential factors of why voter turnout tends to be higher in local 
        and state-level elections vs. national elections. India generally has a comparatively higher turnout rate, and is unique in that 
        voter turnout increases as each level of election decreases. The United States and Europe, where most of the turnout research 
        has been conducted, face the opposite effects. I used election data from 1967-2021, and explored some potential explanations like 
        which type of parties win at what rates of turnout, if there is an effect in the timing of state and national elections, 
        and what regional differences exist.
